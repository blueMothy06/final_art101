  <h1>Hey, you made it!</h1>
  <p>Having been inspired by a previous assignment that revolved around searching
    up AIs controlling algorithms, I wanted to create a game about going on the
    Internet. The concept has definitely changed since then and focuses more about
    the distractions we might face when surfing the web. It also rolls with a
    wacky narrative, simply because I enjoy a sort of story to go along with any
    game that I make and I wanted to go wild with these distractions that may
    appear. This, in a sense, reminds me of photoshopping an image to make it seem
    'legit,' but instead with my typical sense of imagination.
